# INSIGHT - Object Detection App for the Visually Impaired

This project is part of a Final Year Project (FYP) titled **INSIGHT: Intelligent Navigation System for Integrated Guidance Haptic Technologies**. It is a native Android application developed in Kotlin, designed to assist visually impaired individuals with indoor navigation through real-time object detection and multimodal feedback.

The app uses a TensorFlow Lite implementation of the YOLOv8 model to identify common indoor objects using the smartphone‚Äôs camera. Users receive feedback through **audio (Text-to-Speech)** in General Mode and **vibration cues** in Specific Mode, enabling non-visual spatial awareness and navigation.
